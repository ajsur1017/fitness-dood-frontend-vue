# capstone
Welcome to fitnessDOOD. This is a simple application that was built using ruby on rails for the backend utilizing postgresql for the database. The front end application which currently has no authentication implemented (TBD) was created to help you stay on track.

## Technologies used:
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Vue.js with vue-router
* Milligram.css
* GitHub
* Heroku (backend hosting)
* Netlify (frontend hosting)

## Talking points:
The dynamic and reactive "hamburger" menu is created using entirly HTML and CSS (ZERO JAVASCRIPT!)
* It is reactive and has multiple animations using transistion and transform. 
* It is dynamic so no matter where you scroll on the page it will always be displayed on the top left corner of the screen.
