        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>This is a simple application that I designed for myself to use to keep track of my daily routine. I have sometimes found that bad dietary decisions are bad due to absent mindedness when it comes to what you have done that day. With this application it has helped me keep track of what I ate and how much water I have drank throughout the day.</p><br>
        <p>Having this application has helped me not only keep track of my food and water but also has helped encourage me to do something, even if its just something small, to help me stay active and healthy. I plan to expand on this application eventually adding authentication so that I can bring this application to many others so the DOOD can help them too!</p><br>
        <p>Thank you for stopping by!</p><br>
